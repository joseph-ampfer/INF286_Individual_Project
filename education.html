        <h1>Educational Resources: Understanding UV Safety</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our educational hub. Here, you can learn about UV radiation, its impact on your health, and how to stay safe under the sun.</p>

        <!-- UV Radiation Explained Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>UV Radiation Explained</h2>
            <p>Ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a type of energy produced by the sun and artificial sources like tanning beds. It is divided into three types based on wavelength:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>UVA (320–400 nm):</strong> Long-wave UV rays that penetrate deep into the skin and contribute to aging and wrinkles.</li>
                <li><strong>UVB (290–320 nm):</strong> Short-wave UV rays that are responsible for sunburn and play a key role in developing skin cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>UVC (100–290 nm):</strong> The most dangerous type of UV radiation, but it is absorbed by the Earth’s atmosphere and does not reach the surface.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding these different types of UV rays and their effects can help you take better care of your skin and overall health.</p>

         <!-- Understanding the UV Index Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Understanding the UV Index</h2>
            <p>The UV Index is a scale that measures the strength of sunburn-producing ultraviolet radiation at a particular place and time. It is a helpful tool for planning outdoor activities and understanding the level of risk.</p>
            <h3>UV Index Levels and Safety Recommendations:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>0-2 (Low):</strong> Minimal risk. Safe to be outside, but consider sunscreen if you have sensitive skin.</li>
                <li><strong>3-5 (Moderate):</strong> Moderate risk. Seek shade during midday hours and wear protective clothing.</li>
                <li><strong>6-7 (High):</strong> High risk. Cover up, use sunscreen, and limit your time in the sun.</li>
                <li><strong>8-10 (Very High):</strong> Very high risk. Take extra precautions—wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and apply sunscreen frequently.</li>
                <li><strong>11+ (Extreme):</strong> Extreme risk. Avoid being outside during midday. Full protection is essential (clothing, hats, sunscreen, and shade).</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/uvindex.jpg" width="50%" />
            <p>By understanding the UV Index and planning your outdoor activities accordingly, you can reduce your risk of sunburn and long-term skin damage.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Sun Safety Tips</h2>
            <p>Protecting your skin from harmful UV exposure is essential for maintaining healthy skin. Follow these practical tips to stay safe under the sun:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use Broad-Spectrum Sunscreen:</strong> Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher and reapply every two hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Wear Protective Clothing:</strong> Opt for long sleeves, wide-brimmed hats, and sunglasses to protect your skin and eyes.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay in the Shade:</strong> Whenever possible, seek shade, especially between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when UV rays are strongest.</li>
                <li><strong>Check the UV Index:</strong> Before heading outside, check the local UV Index to understand the level of risk and plan accordingly.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Tanning Beds:</strong> Artificial sources of UV radiation can be just as harmful as the sun and significantly increase the risk of skin cancer.</li>
            </ul>

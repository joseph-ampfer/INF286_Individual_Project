        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to UV Sense! We’re dedicated to helping you take control of your sun safety through accurate UV monitoring and personalized recommendations.</p>

        <!-- Our Story Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>UV Sense was founded by <strong>Joey Ampfer</strong>, who began his journey in the medical field. While in medical school, Joey founded the AI in Medicine interest group, where he explored how technology could transform healthcare. After witnessing the limitations of traditional health tools in addressing preventable issues like UV exposure, Joey decided to pivot into tech.</p>
            <p>The result was UV Sense—a small, powerful device designed to help people monitor their UV exposure and make informed decisions about sun safety. From its inception, UV Sense has been committed to combining cutting-edge technology with a mission to promote health and well-being.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>Mission Statement:</strong> "Promoting health through sun safety by leveraging technology to empower people with actionable data."
            </blockquote>

            <p>UV Sense started as a personal project in Joey’s small apartment, with just a prototype and a big vision: to make sun safety accessible and easy for everyone. Today, UV Sense is helping people around the world track their sun exposure and reduce their risk of skin damage and related health issues.</p>

            <h2>The Science Behind UV Sense</h2>
            <p>UV Sense uses advanced UV sensors to provide accurate real-time readings of ultraviolet radiation. Understanding UV exposure is critical for skin health because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Prolonged UV exposure</strong> can cause sunburn, premature aging, and increase the risk of skin cancer.</li>
                <li><strong>UVA and UVB rays</strong> penetrate the skin at different levels, leading to different types of damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitoring UV levels</strong> helps users make informed decisions about sunscreen application, clothing choices, and time spent outdoors.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>UV Sense’s sensor technology is paired with a sophisticated algorithm that adjusts recommendations based on personal data like skin type, past exposure, and environmental conditions. This combination of hardware and software allows for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Highly accurate UV readings</strong> updated in real-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized sun safety recommendations</strong> delivered directly to your smartphone.</li>
                <li><strong>Historical tracking</strong> to help users understand their long-term exposure patterns.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The technology behind UV Sense is designed to be user-friendly, reliable, and scientifically validated to ensure that every reading is accurate and actionable.</p>

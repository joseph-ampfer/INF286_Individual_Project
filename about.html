        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <div>UV Sense was founded by <strong>Joey Ampfer</strong>, who began his journey in the medical field. While
          in medical school, Joey founded the AI in Medicine interest group, where he explored how technology
          could transform healthcare. After witnessing the limitations of traditional health tools in addressing
          preventable issues like UV exposure, Joey decided to pivot into tech.</div>
          <div>The result was UV Sense—a small, powerful device designed to help people monitor their UV exposure and
          make informed decisions about sun safety. From its inception, UV Sense has been committed to combining
          cutting-edge technology with a mission to promote health and well-being.</div>
          <div>UV Sense started as a personal project in Joey’s small apartment, with just a prototype and a big vision:
          to make sun safety accessible and easy for everyone. Today, UV Sense is helping people around the world
          track their sun exposure and reduce their risk of skin damage and related health issues.</div>

        <h1>Our Why</h1>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <div>Prolonged UV exposure can cause sunburn, premature aging, and increase the risk of
            skin cancer.
            UVA and UVB rays penetrate the skin at different levels, leading to different types
            of damage.
            Monitoring UV levels helps users make informed decisions about sunscreen
            application, clothing choices, and time spent outdoors.</div>
          <!-- <div>UV Sense’s sensor technology is paired with a sophisticated algorithm that adjusts recommendations based
            on personal data like skin type, past exposure, and environmental conditions. This combination of
            hardware and software allows for
            Highly accurate UV readings updated in real-time.
            Personalized sun safety recommendations delivered directly to your smartphone.
            Historical tracking to help users understand their long-term exposure patterns.</div> -->
          <div>The technology behind UV Sense is designed to be user-friendly, reliable, and scientifically validated to
              ensure that every reading is accurate and actionable.</div>
